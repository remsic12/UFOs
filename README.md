# UFOs
## Overview of Project
* In this project we are building an HTML page for Dana; we have built the page to have search functionality to help people filter or search through all the different sightings that have occured across the United States. The data has 5 metrics all of which you can search and extract data from to help you peform your analysis.

## Results
* Using the web page is very self explanitory but below we will walk you through how to use it.
* Here is the home webpage

* As you can see it is very straightforward, we have a quick introduction followed by the data and a search box for all 5 metrics on the right
  *To filter and search the data go to the filter search section on the right and search by one of our 5 metrics in that perspective metrics search box. For this example I am going to search for Wisconsin, this is the state metric which has the 2 letter state code WI. This box is circled in blue and as you can see filters the data. Once you are done searching simply delete out what you searched and the data chart will refresh to its original version

## Summary
* One drawback of my current design is having the entire data table on the webpage creates a very long page, I think it would be more user friendly if the page just contained the search filters.
  * I would store data in a seperate page and have page only contain search filters for users to simply search what they need, I would want them to also then be able to view all the data in a seperate page
  * I would also build a map page where you would see all the sitings across US via a map, this could provide us with further insight if we can see where UFO sigtings occured on the same day, maybe they are traveling together!
